# 🧠 MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project demonstrates how to build and train a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the **MNIST dataset** and **TensorFlow/Keras** in Python. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Uses the MNIST dataset (70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9).
- Built using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Model architecture: Fully Connected Neural Network (Dense layers).
- Trained and evaluated using test accuracy.
- Visualizations for input data and model performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
